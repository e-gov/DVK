Recently I had a requirement to sort an XML document based on the tag names in the document.
You can sort it using XSLT, but this post tells you how to sort the XML nodes through Java.

Lets extend the com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.util.DOMUtil or org.apache.xerces.internal.util.DOMUtil class which has some basic utility methods. And I'm going to extend it by adding a method called sortChildNodes() .

This method sorts the children of the given node in descending or ascending order with the given Comparator. And it recurses upto the specified depth if available.
